        <p>
          I have completed masterâ€™s degree in computer science from the University of Idaho, focusing on language-based security. As a Graduate Research Assistant, I worked with the Center for Secure
          and Dependable Systems (CSDS) to develop techniques and tools for software security and privacy. Previously, I was an Associate Software Engineer at Cedar Gate Technologies, developing
          software applications within the .NET Framework. I received a Bachelor of Science degree in computer science from Kathmandu University, Nepal.
